## Mid-term Exam Study Guide
### SMPA 2152 (Fall 23)
<br>
The mid-term exam will consist of two parts:

* Part I will consist of multiple choice, true/false, and short answer questions about the lecture material (Monday classes). Part I will be closed-notes, closed-book.

* Part II will consist of an R coding exercise similar to the ones you completed for homework. This part will be open-notes, open-book, and open-internet. That is, any tools you would typically use to complete a homework assignment will be available to you, including the professor. I will be available to answer questions as you complete Part II. However, this is a timed test. I suggest that you review your class notes and homework assignments so that you can quickly recall key functions and structures, even if you occasionally need to look up function arguments.
