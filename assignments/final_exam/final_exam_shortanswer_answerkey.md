## Final Exam - Short Answer Questions
### SMPA 2152 (Fall 23)

1. Evaluate the following survey question:

    "How comfortable are you with GW police carrying firearms in order to protect the campus from shootings and other violent emergencies?
    
    * Very comfortable
    * Not very comfortable
    * Not at all comfortable"
    
    Describe at least two ways in which you would improve this question. Write a new question that applies your suggested improvements.

    > Possible answers include:
    
    > * The question leads the respondent to a particular answer by including the phrase, "in order to protect the campus from shootings and other violent emergencies." In addition, the question only asks if the respondent is comfortable, not if "how comfortable or uncomfortable," which could lead to acquiescence bias (the respondent simply agrees with the premise of the question).
    > * The response options do not encompass the full range of possible answers.
    > * "Comfort" is a subjective concept that may mean differen things to different people. A better wording would be "Do you approve or disapprove..."
    > * "Shootings and other violent emergencies" is a double-barreled phrase, since a respondent could theoretically approve of campus police carrying firearms to protect the campus from shootings, but not other violent crimes.

2. In your opinion, is polling is a trustworthy source of information about the 2024 presidential election? Drawing on your knowledge of polling, provide at least two arguments that support your position.

    > Arguments in favor of polling being trustworthy include:
    
    > * Pollsters now weight by education, which was shown to be a source of non-response bias in the 2016 election polls.
    > * Polls are not as far off from the actual result as we sometimes think.
    > * There is no evidence of a "shy Trump voter" effect, which reduces the likelihood of missing not at random (MNAR) data.
    
    > Arguments against polling being trustworthy include:
    
    > * Despite weighting for education, the 2020 election polls were still somewhat inaccurate. This is likely due to Trump voters being less likey to answer polls by virtue of the fact that they are Trump voters, and not for any other reason. This is missing not at random (MNAR) data which we cannot correct for.
    > * One of the potential weighting variables to include in future polls is social trust, which is a difficult to measure concept.
    > * Non-response bias continues to worsen as response rates for all types of polls decline.

3. Suppose you conducted a poll of GW students about their vote in student government elections. What variables would you use to weight your survey results? Provide at least two variables and explain why you selected those variables.

    > Possible answers include:
    
    > * Year in school: some class years more likely to respond than others
    > * Major: some majors, e.g., social sciences, are more likely to respond than other majors
    > * On- vs. off-campus housing: students in on-campus housing are more accessible than those in off-campus housing
    > * Employed or not: students who are not employed are more accessible than students who are employed
    > * Political party: Democrats are more likely to respond to pollsters than Republicans
