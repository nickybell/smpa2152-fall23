\frame{\frametitle{What is my hypothesis?}

Choosing a hypothesis is all about avoiding error:\\~\\

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item \textbf{Type I error}: False positives
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> Sending the innocent to jail - this is bad!\\~\\
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Type II error}: False negatives
    \begin{itemize}
        \item<.-> Letting the guilty go free - we can accept this
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
~\\
\only<3->{Our goal is to reduce Type I error. One way we can do this is by adopting \textbf{falsifiability} as our standard of research design. We think as hard (or harder) about how our hypothesis can be \textit{dis}proven than about how they can be proven.}

\begin{block}{P-value}
The chance that we would get a particular result from our test if the true answer is false
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
    \item The p-value is our chance of committing a Type I error - sending the innocent to jail
    \item Common p-value cut-offs in scientific research: .01, .05, and .1 indicate \textbf{statistical significance}
    \item P-values are a product of the data we use and our choices about what we include and exclude from the analysis.

Use FiveThirtyEight's online modeling tool to test what you think is the best approach to answering the question. There are no right or wrong answers - just select the model you think is best, and report your results in the form:

\frame{\frametitle{Related Abuses}

\begin{itemize}[<+->]
    \item \textbf{Multiple comparisons problem}: As we do more tests on a single dataset, the chances of a Type I error increases (because there is a 1, 5, 10\% chance of Type I error with each test - that adds up!)
    \item \textbf{HARKing}: \textbf{H}ypothesizing \textbf{a}fter \textbf{r}esults are \textbf{k}nown
    \item \textbf{File drawer bias}: We hear about the statistically significant results, but not the insignificant results (except in the \href{https://www.jasnh.com/}{Journal of Results in Support of the Null Hypothesis})
    \item Confusing statistical significance with substantive significance

    \item The key to any data analysis project is a quality sample, which is determined by two elements:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A \textbf{random sample} of the population
        \item The \textbf{sample size} is sufficiently large

~\\
\begin{itemize}[<+(1)->]
    \item A failure of each unit to have a uniform probability of being drawn from the population is known as \textbf{selection bias}
    \item Units are ``selecting'' into our data because they are more observable than other units
    \item Selection bias reduces our \textbf{generalizability} to the population because the data is not representative of the population
