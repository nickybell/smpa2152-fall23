* These lecture slides only take about 45 minutes, so need to come prepared with group work or to move into R content with latter part of class
* Designing for Statistics slide doesn't really connect with Science of Data Viz slide
* This is a lecture that benefits from a practice talk because there are a lot of examples that need to be explained and related to other content
* Surprising amount of student engagement on evaluating graphs
